# ProjectMafia

Before opening up the project, please be sure to have Unity version 2020.3.19f1 installed. Any older versions can cause problems. We'll be using this version for making the game.

In addition to this, when you are making something new or integrating something new, please do so in a new branch on SourceTree and a new scene on Unity to avoid merging issues.

Thank you!
